# RNGine

A simple dice and coin-flip app for iPhone and Apple Watch.  
RNGine helps you roll dice (d20, d6, full D&D set) or flip a coin quickly.  
On Apple Watch, it defaults to a **d20** or **coin flip** for fast use.  
On iPhone, you can choose what to roll and see history.

## ðŸ“– Notes
- Keep the Watch app **fast and minimal** â€” one tap = one roll.  
- The iPhone app can be the "controller" where you configure dice, view history, and access extra features.  
- Extended features (like **Magic Eight Ball Mode**) should not compromise the core: quick random generation.
